	abstract = {Accurate vehicle sideslip angle estimation is crucial for vehicle stability control. In this article, an enabling event-triggered sideslip angle estimator is proposed by using the kinematic information from a low-cost global positioning system (GPS) and an on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU). First, a preliminary vehicle sideslip angle is derived using the heading angle of GPS and the yaw rate of IMU, and an event-triggered mechanism is proposed to eliminate the accumulative estimation error. The algorithm convergence is guaranteed through theoretical deduction. Second, a longitudinal and a lateral vehicle velocity are obtained using the preliminary vehicle sideslip angle and the measured GPS velocity and their kinematic relationship, based on which a multisensor fusion and a multistep Kalman filter scheme are, respectively, presented to realize longitudinal and lateral vehicle velocity estimation. By doing this, the update frequency and estimation accuracy of the vehicle sideslip angle estimate can be further improved to meet the requirement of online implementation. Finally, the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed scheme are verified under comprehensive driving conditions through both hardware-in-loop (HIL) and field tests. The results show that the proposed event-triggered sideslip angle estimator has a mean estimation error of 0.029{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ and of 0.14{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ in the HIL and field tests, exhibiting better estimation accuracy, reliability, and real-time performance compared with other typical estimators.},

	abstract = {Kalman ﬁlters are routinely used for many data fusion applications including navigation, tracking, and simultaneous localization and mapping problems. However, signiﬁcant time and effort is frequently required to tune various Kalman ﬁlter model parameters, e.g. process noise covariance, pre-whitening ﬁlter models for non-white noise, etc. Conventional optimization techniques for tuning can get stuck in poor local minima and can be expensive to implement with real sensor data. To address these issues, a new “black box” Bayesian optimization strategy is developed for automatically tuning Kalman ﬁlters. In this approach, performance is characterized by one of two stochastic objective functions: normalized estimation error squared (NEES) when ground truth state models are available, or the normalized innovation error squared (NIS) when only sensor data is available. By intelligently sampling the parameter space to both learn and exploit a nonparametric Gaussian process surrogate function for the NEES/NIS costs, Bayesian optimization can efﬁciently identify multiple local minima and provide uncertainty quantiﬁcation on its results.},

The test case was originally proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for evaluation of Electronic Stability Programs (ESP) performance during an oversteer situation on high friction. The modified test case presented here accounts for the heavy vehicle dynamics through three main modifications of the original test case. Firstly, to avoid rollover, the test case is performed on low friction. Secondly, to avoid excess understeer behaviour, the steering input frequency is lowered compared to the original test. Thirdly, to account for response times, the responsiveness and stability criteria are modified. These modifications are derived from hardware in the loop simulations and field tests for different tractor/truck and trailer combinations. By using the modified responsiveness and stability criteria it was shown that the tested ESP system could be objectively evaluated. A clear improvement on vehicle stability was seen in the results when ESP was used.},

            In this paper, a new approach in estimating the lateral tire forces and hitch-forces of a vehicle–trailer system is introduced. It is shown that the proposed hitch-force estimation is independent of trailer mass and geometry, by utilizing the vehicle velocity, acceleration, torque engine, wheel's speed, and steering angle measurements. The designed lateral tire forces and hitch-force estimations' algorithm can be used for any ball type trailer without any priori information on the trailer parameters. A vehicle–trailer dynamic model is proposed to design an observer for the estimation of the hitch-forces and lateral tire forces. Simulations' studies in carsim along with experimental tests are used to validate the presented method. The results confirm the accuracy of the developed observer, and the experimental tests' results show that there is a good agreement between the estimated and actual lateral tire forces as well as the hitch-forces.},

Each unit or axle can be individually braked or propelled whilst the other units or axles are excluded from such action. This may achieve the best energy efficiency. However, this can also lead to potential yaw stability problems such as jackknifing and trailer swing, especially under bad loading and weather conditions. This paper describes the above instabilities and introduces a nonlinear single-track model to study the vehicle dynamics of the tractor-semitrailer combination. The effects of different vehicle and environment parameters are analysed with this vehicle model. A safe operating envelope for limiting the wheel forces is obtained using this vehicle model. Since the vehicle model introduced in this paper is computationally effective, it can be run online in real vehicles, with an instantaneous safe operating envelope obtained for the momentary conditions. Thus, yaw instabilities such as jackknifing and trailer swing may be avoided.},

However, sensors that can be used for direct measurements are often complex, expensive, and difficult to install in commercial vehicles. To estimate the vehicle sideslip angle, a state observer derived from the extended Kalman filter (EKF) method is proposed, and the state observer is estimated based on steering torque rather than steering angle. The transfer functions between the sideslip angle–steering torque and sideslip angle–steering angle are established, respectively, and the analysis shows that the steering torque signal has a more rapid and more direct reaction due to the hydraulic pressure in the steering system. Finally, the proposed method is validated using Simulink/TruckSim simulation hardware-in-the-loop bench test, and the results show that the proposed method can accurately reflect the actual state of the sideslip angle with good reliability and effectiveness.},

	abstract = {The knowledge of key vehicle states is crucial to guarantee adequate safety levels for modern passenger cars, for which active safety control systems are lifesavers. In this regard, vehicle sideslip angle is a pivotal state for the characterization of lateral vehicle behavior. However, measuring sideslip angle is expensive and unpractical, which has led to many years of research on techniques to estimate it instead. This paper presents a novel method to estimate vehicle sideslip angle, with an innovative combination of a kinematic-based approach and a dynamic-based approach: part of the output of the kinematic-based approach is fed as input to the dynamic-based approach, and vice-versa. The dynamic-based approach exploits an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with a double-track vehicle model and a modified Dugoff tire model, that is simple yet ensures accuracy similar to the well-known Magic Formula. The proposed method is successfully assessed on a large amount of experimental data obtained on different race tracks, and compared with a traditional approach presented in the literature. Results show that the sideslip angle is estimated with an average error of 0.5 deg, and that the implemented cross-combination allows to further improve the estimation of the vehicle longitudinal velocity compared to current state-of-the-art techniques, with interesting perspectives for future onboard implementation.},

The results show that the dynamics-based estimators are suitable at low vehicle velocities when tires operate in the linear region. In contrast, the kinematics-based methods yield superior estimation performance at high vehicle velocities, and the inclusion of the dual GPS receivers is beneficial even when there is large disturbance to the steering angle. Of utmost importance, it is experimentally manifested that the neural network-based estimator can perform well in all manoeuvres once the training datasets are properly selected.},

The performance of this approach may deteriorate if the initial estimate is poor i.e. far from true state. Iterative version of EKF developed by Wishner et al. (1969) for systems modelled as ODEs can alleviate this difficulty with negligible additional computational efforts as it involves smoothing of the prior estimate. There are many systems that involve different time scales and are described by Differential-Algebraic equations (DAEs). Extension of Bayesian state estimation approach such as EKF for handling nonlinear DAEs is relatively recent development (Beccera et al. (2001) and Mandela et al. (2010)). In this work, taking motivation from Wishner et al. (1969), an iterative EKF (IEKF) scheme is proposed for systems modelled as DAEs. The efficacy of the proposed DAE-IEKF is evaluated using simulation studies of Nickel-Hydrogen electrode system and divided wall distillation column system. Analysis of the simulation results reveals that the proposed approach results in a reasonable improvement in the estimation performance when compared with performance of the conventional DAE-EKF.},

However, the trailer is sparsely equipped with sensors and the standardized communication between truck and trailer is reduced to braking signals. This paper presents an approach for estimating the lateral and vertical tire forces, roll behavior and articulation angle of the trailer for different loading conditions solely based on trailer signals using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Due to missing information from the truck, the varying mass and center of gravity (COG) based on different loading conditions must be estimated only on trailer signals. The investigation on structural observability shows that an estimation of all unknown parameters with the UKF is not possible. Thus, the usage of a substitute mass and COG is necessary and calculated based on the trailer’s axle load and domain knowledge of the usual practical loading distribution. The method is validated for different substitute masses and COGs with experimental data from a fully and partially loaded trailer.},

	abstract = {For further development of assistance systems and autonomous systems for tractor-semitrailers, knowledge of relevant trailer states and parameters is necessary. However, the trailer is sparsely equipped with sensors and the standardized communication between truck and trailer is reduced to braking signals. This paper presents an approach for estimating the lateral and vertical tire forces, roll behavior and articulation angle of the trailer for different loading conditions solely based on trailer signals using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Due to missing information from the truck, the varying mass and center of gravity (COG) based on different loading conditions must be estimated only on trailer signals. The investigation on structural observability shows that an estimation of all unknown parameters with the UKF is not possible. Thus, the usage of a substitute mass and COG is necessary and calculated based on the trailer’s axle load and domain knowledge of the usual practical loading distribution. The method is validated for different substitute masses and COGs with experimental data from a fully and partially loaded trailer.},

We introduce a state-space linear model of road train planar motion obtained via the analytical linearization of the nonlinear model under the assumption of small slip and jackknifing angles. For this state-space linear model, we devise a linear functional of its state variables to calculate the slip and jackknifing angles. Using these proposed state-space models and linear functional of its states we design a functional observer to estimate the slip and jackknifing angles. Finally, analyzing the computer simulation results, we show that the proposed algorithm of the slip and jackknifing angles of a road train estimation works fairly well, with low estimation error, even under quite difficult driving maneuvers.},

The system of ODEs has the minimum number of states and equations that enables efficient computations yet maintains the most important nonlinear vehicle dynamic behavior and allows actuator coordination and energy consumption evaluation. As examples, we build different models of a 4-unit long combination vehicle, i.e., two-track 11-axle and single-track 6-axle nonlinear models as well as a linear single-track 6-axle model. We compare the performance of these models to experimental data of different driving maneuvers. The nonlinear single-track model demonstrates close dynamic behavior to the experiment, which makes it an efficient alternative to the two-track model. The vehicle equations can be generated automatically by using the code provided in this paper and subsequently used for conducting frequency analysis, evaluating energy consumption, deriving performance measures from simulations, and facilitating optimal control applications that involve combined steering, braking and propulsion control.},

The normal force of each axle included in the model was estimated based on the longitudinal load transfer model. Physical constraints were applied to reduce model states. Accurate sideslip angle and cornering stiffness are essential for vehicle control safety and autonomous driving performance. The sideslip angle and cornering stiffness were simultaneously estimated using a dual linear time-varying (LTV) Kalman filter. The observability matrix guaranteed the convergence of the proposed estimation algorithm.

In this paper, an improved TDCP velocity estimation approach has been proposed and tested. The new approach depends only on receiver position at epoch t and satellite positions at epoch t and t+Δt. Satellite velocities are not required in this calculation. This proposed algorithm has been validated using static and kinematic field test data, showing that equivalent velocity accuracy achievable by using differential GPS techniques can be made possible with the proposed standalone GPS method.},

	abstract = {According to statistics, articulated vehicles like tractor-semitrailers represent over 55\% of heavy goods traffic in France. In some cases, this type of truck may have unstable behavior, resulting in high risks of accidents. Jackknifing is defined by a loss of yaw stability of the articulated system. It most commonly occurs when the semi-trailer is empty. This paper presents the development of an intelligent jackknifing safety system. The objective is to develop a strategy to detect a critical situation (jackknifing) and trigger a warning message under dangerous conditions such unstable yaw. A new system for articulated vehicles jackknifing detection and prediction is designed. This system uses on one hand, a nominal model of articulated vehicle making it possible to determine the vehicle dynamic state such as the relative yaw angle. On the other hand, detection algorithm is based on a jackknifing criterion and on the prediction function of jackknifing, in view of estimating the time to jackknifing. The validation of the results is done by using PROSPER, which is a very detailed commercial simulator.},

Therefore, real-time estimates of the vehicle dynamic states and tire-road contact parameters are invaluable for enhancing the performance of vehicle control systems, such as anti-lock brake system (ABS) and electronic stability program (ESP). Today's production vehicles are equipped with onboard sensors (e.g. a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, steering wheel angle sensor, and wheel speed sensors), which when used in conjunction with certain model-based or kinematics-based observers can be used to identify relevant tire and vehicle states for optimal control of comfort, stability and handling. Vehicle state estimation is becoming ever more relevant with the increased sophistication of chassis control systems. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in the field of vehicle and tire state estimation.

	title = {{LIGHT} {VEHICLE} {ESC} {PERFORMANCE} {TEST} {DEVELOPMENT}},
	abstract = {On September 18, 2006 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced a proposal that would require installation of electronic stability control (ESC) as standard equipment on all light vehicles by model year 2012 (1). The decision to mandate ESC required that NHTSA develop an ESC compliance test and evaluation criteria. This paper describes the proposed test maneuver and discusses the methods proposed to interpret the data generated by that maneuver. NHTSA's ESC proposed compliance test maneuver, the Sine with Dwell, was used to produce all the data described in this paper. This maneuver is based on a single cycle, 0.7 Hz steering input, with a 500 ms pause between the third and fourth quarter cycles. Output from Sine with Dwell tests is used to evaluate both the lateral stability and responsiveness of ESC- equipped light vehicles. NHTSA proposes acceptable lateral stability be assessed with two performance criteria, intended to encourage yaw rate to decay in a controlled manner. These criteria compare the yaw rates measured 1.0 and 1.75 seconds after completion of the maneuver's steering inputs to the first local yaw rate peak produced after the second steering reversal. These "yaw rate ratios" must be less than or equal to 35 and 20 percent, respectively. To ensure that a balance between lateral stability and the ability of the vehicle to effectively respond to the driver's inputs is maintained, NHTSA has proposed a responsiveness metric supplement that used to assess lateral stability. The proposed metric is based on vehicle lateral displacement calculated 1.07 seconds after initiation of the maneuver's steering inputs.},

The test case was originally proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for evaluation of Electronic Stability Programs (ESP) performance during an oversteer situation on high friction. The modified test case presented here accounts for the heavy vehicle dynamics through three main modifications of the original test case. Firstly, to avoid rollover, the test case is performed on low friction. Secondly, to avoid excess understeer behaviour, the steering input frequency is lowered compared to the original test. Thirdly, to account for response times, the responsiveness and stability criteria are modified. These modifications are derived from hardware in the loop simulations and field tests for different tractor/truck and trailer combinations. By using the modified responsiveness and stability criteria it was shown that the tested ESP system could be objectively evaluated. A clear improvement on vehicle stability was seen in the results when ESP was used.},

A method is presented for integrating Inertial Navigation System sensors with GPS measurements to provide higher update rate estimates of the vehicle states. The influence of road side-slope and vehicle roll on estimating vehicle sideslip is investigated. A method using one GPS antenna that estimates accelerometer errors occurring from vehicle roll and sensor drift is first developed. A second method is then presented utilizing a two-antenna GPS system to provide direct measurements of vehicle roll and heading, resulting in improved sideslip estimation. Additionally, it is shown that the tire sideslip estimates can be used to estimate the tire cornering stiffnesses. The experimental results for the GPS-based sideslip angle measurement and cornering stiffness estimates compare favorably to theoretical predictions, suggesting that this technique has merit for future implementation in vehicle safety systems},

From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations.

	abstract = {This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples.},

	abstract = {Abstract A detailed finite element (FE) model for the analysis of realistic force transmission between a rolling
tire and a rigid flat road is presented. In order to achieve a more precise investigation, enhanced friction models
for the contact analysis are employed. The model is based on an extensive program of material tests and
measurements to fit the models. The investigated high performance tire has been validated for its static and
dynamic stiffness as well as footprints, deformed shapes and temperature fields on the surface and inside the
tire. Based on the enhanced friction models, the tire’s frictional behaviour is computed according to its relative
sliding velocity, contact pressure and temperature. In this way, the contact formulation for the tire model is
significantly improved and a stable simulation with more accurate results is obtained. Temperature input is
generated by the thermo-mechanically coupled tire simulation which is developed at the ISD. The respective
experimental data out of the linear friction test on a dry granite surface are used for parameter identification
based on an optimization algorithm. Tire frictional behaviour is then characterized by a nonlinear, continuous
tanh-function to describe the stress-displacement interaction. The user subroutine FRIC written in FORTRAN
is applied to control the frictional parameters. Finally, the capability of the FE simulation for predicting the
fundamental frictional characteristics at braking and at cornering are widely verified for different speed, load
and temperature conditions based on the Savkoor, Huemer and Coulomb friction law.

However, quantifying errors and uncertainties in NN-based inference is more complicated than in traditional methods. This is because in addition to aleatoric uncertainty associated with noisy data, there is also uncertainty due to limited data, but also due to NN hyperparameters, overparametrization, optimization and sampling errors as well as model misspecification. Although there are some recent works on uncertainty quantification (UQ) in NNs, there is no systematic investigation of suitable methods towards quantifying the total uncertainty effectively and efficiently even for function approximation, and there is even less work on solving partial differential equations and learning operator mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using NNs. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework that includes uncertainty modeling, new and existing solution methods, as well as evaluation metrics and post-hoc improvement approaches. To demonstrate the applicability and reliability of our framework, we present an extensive comparative study in which various methods are tested on prototype problems, including problems with mixed input-output data, and stochastic problems in high dimensions. In the Appendix, we include a comprehensive description of all the UQ methods employed, which we will make available as open-source library of all codes included in this framework.},

Basically, any level of complexity can be realized through the choice of the nonlinear functions and the dimensionality of their domain. Results of an uncertainty quantification for deep regression are compared against those obtained by a statistical reference method. The reference method utilizes knowledge about the underlying nonlinear functions and is based on Bayesian linear regression using a prior reference. The flexibility, together with the availability of a reference solution, makes the framework suitable for defining benchmark sets for uncertainty quantification. Reliability of uncertainty quantification is assessed in terms of coverage probabilities, and accuracy through the size of calculated uncertainties. We illustrate the proposed framework by applying it to current approaches for uncertainty quantification in deep regression. In addition, results for three real-world regression tasks are presented.},

Recently, various machine learning models have also been developed to tackle problems in the field of scientific computing with applications to computational science and engineering (CSE). Physics-informed neural networks and deep operator networks are two such models for solving partial differential equations and learning operator mappings, respectively. In this regard, a comprehensive study of UQ methods tailored specifically for scientific machine learning (SciML) models has been provided in [45]. Nevertheless, and despite their theoretical merit, implementations of these methods are not straightforward, especially in large-scale CSE applications, hindering their broad adoption in both research and industry settings. In this paper, we present an open-source Python library (https://github.com/Crunch-UQ4MI), termed NeuralUQ and accompanied by an educational tutorial, for employing UQ methods for SciML in a convenient and structured manner. The library, designed for both educational and research purposes, supports multiple modern UQ methods and SciML models. It is based on a succinct workflow and facilitates flexible employment and easy extensions by the users. We first present a tutorial of NeuralUQ and subsequently demonstrate its applicability and efficiency in four diverse examples, involving dynamical systems and high-dimensional parametric and time-dependent PDEs.},

Bayesian marginalization can particularly improve the accuracy and calibration of modern deep neural networks, which are typically underspeciﬁed by the data, and can represent many compelling but different solutions. We show that deep ensembles provide an effective mechanism for approximate Bayesian marginalization, and propose a related approach that further improves the predictive distribution by marginalizing within basins of attraction, without signiﬁcant overhead. We also investigate the prior over functions implied by a vague distribution over neural network weights, explaining the generalization properties of such models from a probabilistic perspective. From this perspective, we explain results that have been presented as mysterious and distinct to neural network generalization, such as the ability to ﬁt images with random labels, and show that these results can be reproduced with Gaussian processes. We also show that Bayesian model averaging alleviates double descent, resulting in monotonic performance improvements with increased ﬂexibility.},

For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This paper proposes a general framework for Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this paper, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics such as the Bayesian treatment of neural networks.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to create a tactical decision-making agent for autonomous driving. However, previous approaches only output decisions and do not provide information about the agent’s conﬁdence in the recommended actions. This paper investigates how a Bayesian RL technique, based on an ensemble of neural networks with additional randomized prior functions (RPF), can be used to estimate the uncertainty of decisions in autonomous driving. A method for classifying whether or not an action should be considered safe is also introduced. The performance of the ensemble RPF method is evaluated by training an agent on a highway driving scenario. It is shown that the trained agent can estimate the uncertainty of its decisions and indicate an unacceptable level when the agent faces a situation that is far from the training distribution. Furthermore, within the training distribution, the ensemble RPF agent outperforms a standard Deep Q-Network agent. In this study, the estimated uncertainty is used to choose safe actions in unknown situations. However, the uncertainty information could also be used to identify situations that should be added to the training process.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of designing robust fusion time-varying Kalman estimators for a class of multisensor networked systems with mixed uncertainties including multiplicative noises, missing measurements, packet dropouts, and uncertain-variance linearly correlated measurement and process white noises. By the augmented approach, the original system is converted into a stochastic parameter system with uncertain noise variances. Furthermore, applying the fictitious noise approach, the original system is converted into one with constant parameters and uncertain noise variances. According to the minimax robust estimation principle, based on the worst-case system with the conservative upper bounds of the noise variances, the five robust fusion time-varying Kalman estimators (predictor, filter, and smoother) are presented by using a unified design approach that the robust filter and smoother are designed based on the robust Kalman predictor, which include three robust weighted state fusion estimators with matrix weights, diagonal matrix weights, and scalar weights, a modified robust covariance intersection fusion estimator, and robust centralized fusion estimator. Their robustness is proved by using a combination method, which consists of Lyapunov equation approach, augmented noise approach, and decomposition approach of nonnegative definite matrix, such that their actual estimation error variances are guaranteed to have the corresponding minimal upper bounds for all admissible uncertainties. The accuracy relations among the robust local and fused time-varying Kalman estimators are proved. A simulation example is shown with application to the continuous stirred tank reactor system to show the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed results.},

To avoid the singularity problem of the state error covariance matrix, the gain matrix is regularized in the first algorithm and a small positive quantity is added to the diagonal elements of the state error covariance matrix in the second algorithm. The two new state-augmented algorithms are easier to keep convergent and have no time latency. Two simulations with a one-degree model and a six degree-of-freedom model demonstrate the proposed algorithms.},

They can vary significantly during the operation of a tire and can effectively modify tire (and thus vehicle) performance. This study presents details of an adaptive magic formula (MF) tire model capable of coping with changes to the tire operating condition. More specifically, extensions have been made to the magic formula expressions for tire cornering stiffness and peak grip level, to account for variations in the tire inflation pressure, load, tread-depth and temperature. As a next step, the benefits of using an adaptive tire model for vehicle control system applications is demonstrated through simulation studies for enhanced vehicle control systems using an adaptive tire model in comparison to traditional control systems based on a non-adaptive tire model with fixed model parameters. In particular, this paper investigates the improvements an adaptive tire model would bring into the following vehicle control system strategies: Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system, Brake Torque Vectoring (BTV) system, and Rear Wheel Steer (RWS) system.},

	abstract = {Dynamic stability is crucial for vehicle safety, not least for heavy commercial vehicle safety. An articulated vehicle such as a tractor-semitrailer may if not correctly designed, handled or rebuilt fall into instability when driving. This is affected by several factors of which the geometric location of the fifth wheel is one. For many reasons the location of the coupling on heavy trucks is not always optimal. The vehicle may e.g. have been rebuilt, with new equipment behind the rear cab panel resulting in a backward relocated fifth wheel. This could negatively influence the directional stability and response. The effect on stability of the fifth wheel location along the longitudinal axis is therefore analysed using a simplified model and a more detailed multi-body model. The study implies that, as the fifth wheel is moved rearwards, the vehicle response becomes highly non-linear and unpredictable. This occurs already at fifth wheel locations close to the rear axle. Moreover, results indicate that as the coupling is moved further rearwards, the tractor-trailer may fall into instability, as it becomes over-steered.},

Our review includes: learning-based control approaches that safely improve performance by learning the uncertain dynamics, reinforcement learning approaches that encourage safety or robustness, and methods that can formally certify the safety of a learned control policy. As data- and learning-based robot control methods continue to gain traction, researchers must understand when and how to best leverage them in real-world scenarios where safety is imperative, such as when operating in close proximity to humans.

	abstract = {We propose combined models of friction for circular surfaces of contact between interacting bodies under conditions of combined dynamics, where the body takes part in the rolling motion in addition to sliding and spinning. In constructing the models, we used numerous experimental results published in the literature concerning the distortion of the symmetric diagram of distribution of contact stresses in the direction of the rolling velocity. To describe this distortion, we propose a linear law with a single coefficient depending on the rolling direction and velocity. Under the assumption that the Coulomb law in differential form holds for a surface element in the interior of the contact spot, we constructed integral representations of the resultant moment and the resultant vector of friction forces.
We show that the relation between the rolling friction and the sliding friction results in the appearance of a nonzero friction force component directed along the normal to the trajectory of motion.
To avoid the use of multiple integrals in the equations of motion, we replace the exact integral representations of the resultant moment and the resultant vector of friction forces by the corresponding Padé approximations. The models thus obtained can be considered as combined rheological models of sliding and rolling friction. To obtain a correct description of the interrelation between the rolling friction and sliding friction in the complete statement of the problem based on these models, it is necessary to known at most six coefficients, which can be determined experimentally for solving the real practical problems.
The equations of the model were exactly integrated in elementary functions for the case in which the distribution of normal contact stresses obeys the Hertz law.},

However, certain possibilities of reducing emissions, manufacturing and operational costs from end vehicles are neglected if the target range of transportation tasks is narrow and known in advance, especially in case of electrified propulsion. Apart from real-time energy optimization, vehicle hardware can be meticulously tailored to best fit a known transportation task. As proposed in this study, a heterogeneous fleet of heavy-vehicles can be designed in a more cost- and energy-efficient manner, if the coupling between vehicle hardware, transportation mission, and infrastructure is considered during initial conceptual-design stages. To this end, a rather large optimization problem was defined and solved to minimize the total cost of fleet ownership in an integrated manner for a real-world case study. In the said case-study, design variables of optimization problem included mission, recharging infrastructure, loading–unloading scheme, number of vehicles of each type, number of trips, vehicle-loading capacity, selection between conventional, fully electric, and hybrid powertrains, size of internal-combustion engines and electric motors, number of axles being powered, and type and size of battery packs. This study demonstrated that by means of integrated fleet customization, battery-electric heavy-vehicles could strongly compete against their conventional combustion-powered counterparts. The primary focus has been put on optimizing vehicle propulsion, transport mission, infrastructure and fleet size rather than routing.},

	abstract = {Numerous deep learning architectures have been developed to accommodate the diversity of time series datasets across different domains. In this article, we survey common encoder and decoder designs used in both one-step-ahead and multi-horizon time series forecasting -- describing how temporal information is incorporated into predictions by each model. Next, we highlight recent developments in hybrid deep learning models, which combine well-studied statistical models with neural network components to improve pure methods in either category. Lastly, we outline some ways in which deep learning can also facilitate decision support with time series data.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic time series forecasting aims at estimating future probabilistic distributions based on given time series observations. It is a widespread challenge in various tasks, such as risk management and decision making. To investigate temporal patterns in time series data and predict subsequent probabilities, the state space model (SSM) provides a general framework. Variants of SSM achieve considerable success in many fields, such as engineering and statistics. However, since underlying processes in real-world scenarios are usually unknown and complicated, actual time series observations are always irregular and noisy. Therefore, it is very difficult to determinate an SSM for classical statistical approaches. In this paper, a general time series forecasting framework, called Deep Non-linear State Space Model (DNLSSM), is proposed to predict the probabilistic distribution based on estimated underlying unknown processes from historical time series data. We fuse deep neural networks and statistical methods to iteratively estimate states and network parameters and thus exploit intricate temporal patterns of time series data. In particular, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is adopted to calculate marginal likelihoods and update distributions recursively for non-linear functions. After that, a non-linear Joseph form covariance update is developed to ensure that calculated covariance matrices in UKF updates are symmetric and positive definitive. Therefore, the authors enhance the tolerance of UKF to round-off errors and manage to combine UKF and deep neural networks. In this manner, the DNLSSM effectively models non-linear correlations between observed time series data and underlying dynamic processes. Experiments in both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the DNLSSM consistently improves the accuracy of probability forecasts compared to the baseline methods.},
